% CREATING A FUNCTION IN A SEPARATE FILE
% To run just type:
% my_factorial(5)
% in the command window of matlab and it'll show the answer - factorial of each number from 1 to n
% THE NAME OF THE FILE MUST BE THE SAME AS THE FUNCTION NAME! i.e.
% my_factorial.m

function f = my_factorial(n)
        f = zeros(1, n);
        for i=1:n
            f(i) = factorial(i);
        end
end
